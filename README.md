##  Abstract
This project focuses on **optimization algorithms for global energy grids**, leveraging the **Graph-Based Optimization Modeling Language (GBOML)** and Python libraries (Pyomo, PuLP, SciPy, Gurobi).  
We model **microgrids** with solar PV, battery storage, demand/load, and distribution nodes, and extend this framework to simulate **interconnected global grids**.  

The work demonstrates how optimization enables:  
- Efficient integration of renewable energy  
- Resource allocation across distributed systems  
- Enhancing resilience and sustainability of global energy networks  

---

## Features
- **Implemented multiple optimization algorithms** (LP, NLP, MILP, MINLP, GA, SA, CMA-ES).  
- **Microgrid Modeling**: solar, battery, demand, distribution nodes.  
- **Global Grid Simulation**: interconnection of multiple microgrids.  
- **Python Parser for GBOML Models**.
